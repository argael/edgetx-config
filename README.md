# EdgeTX Configuration Files

My personal EdgeTX configuration files for a **Radiomaster TX15**.

## Backup and Restore

Simply connect the **EdgeTX radio** to the computer and select "USB Storage".

Then execute the backup script with the path to the **EdgeTX radio** mounted drive.

```bash
./backup.sh "/Volumes/NO NAME"
```

> On MacOS, the mount volume is set to `/Volumes/NO NAME` so you can omit the parameter.

It will create a `backups` folder with 2 sub-folders: 
- `archives` with the Zip files
- `raw` with all the file copied from the **Radio**
